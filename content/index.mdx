The following pages consist of documentation for Deskball Mobile App, a project developed in the Fall 2020 semester for CS440 - Advanced Systems Design.

The recipient of this documentation should receive access to a folder containing the relevant Flutter project. The documentation will reference specific files from that project and reference where things have been implemented and then document what is not completed.
